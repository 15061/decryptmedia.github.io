# Device Recovery

To ensure you can use your wallet (and participate in token redemptions), please go to device settings and check that your device is verified.

Device recovery requests appear when we do not recognize the device that you are on, due to switching devices, re-installing or device configurations out of our control.

1. If the device is unverified for any reason, you will see the “recover device” option appear in the wallet settings (in app menu -&gt; “settings” -&gt; “wallet settings”)

2. To complete the authorization, Select “recover device”, re-enter your PIN, and tap “Start recovery”

3. Recovery can take up to 12 hours, but you’ll know it's underway once you see the “Abort device recovery” option in the wallet settings:

Once you're done, the menu should update with no required device recovery actions.
